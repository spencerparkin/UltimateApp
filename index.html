<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<!-- This page needs a lot of CSS help. -->

<p>
The purpose of this site is to demonstrate to prospective employers a basic knowledge of
various web-development technologies including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP and MySQL.
These initial examples are simple, but I hope to add more and more sophisticated pages as time goes by.
<ul>
	<li>Guest Book -- Sign the guest book while you're here.</li>
	<li><a href="maze.html">Maze Demo</a> -- Generate mazes with JavaScript.</li>
	<li><a href="LonePeak.php">Lone Peak Hike Report</a> -- Flip through hike pictures with PHP.</li>
	<li>What else?...</li>
</ul>
